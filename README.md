# Rt_estimate_reconstruction

"compare_estimates.R" is core of the code and uses methods in other R scripts to rebuilt the Rt estimates from the different sources.

Additionally data from "KITmetricslab/reproductive_numbers" is needed.  Make sure both repositories are stored in the same directory.

Before loading ETH data run the script "ETH/otherScripts/format_linelist_data.R" to calculate the delays.
